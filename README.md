## 👋 About Me

I'm **Mohamed Omar Bacha**, a cybersecurity engineer specializing in penetration testing, web application security, and network defense. I enjoy finding creative, reliable ways to discover vulnerabilities and harden systems.

* 🔧 Tools I use: **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, **Kali Linux**, **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, **John the Ripper**
* 🎯 Focus areas: Web App Pentesting, Network Security, Exploit Validation, Secure Configurations
* 📫 Contact: `omarbacha222@gmail.com` (replace with preferred contact)

## 🛠️ Skills & Expertise

* **Offensive Security:** Penetration testing methodologies, vulnerability discovery, exploit verification
* **Web Security:** OWASP Top 10, secure HTTP headers, authentication/authorization testing
* **Network Security:** TCP/IP, firewall evasion techniques, service enumeration, lateral movement basics
* **Tools & Platforms:** Burp Suite, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, Hashcat
* **Languages:** Bash, Python (scripting for automation & PoCs), basic PHP/SQL knowledge for testing

## 🔍 Penetration Testing Highlights

> These are real testing categories and findings I've performed and validated during engagements and CTFs.

### Web (HTTP / Application) — Notable Verifications

* **PHP — Command Injection**: identification and exploitation of unsanitized input leading to command execution on the host.
* **HTTP — User-Agent based bypasses**: manipulating `User-Agent` to bypass simple filters or WAF rules.
* **HTTP — IP Restriction Bypass**: techniques used to bypass IP-based access controls (e.g., header spoofing, trusted proxy exploitation).
* **HTTP — Directory Indexing**: discovery of exposed directories and sensitive files due to missing index pages.
* **HTTP — Headers**: verification of missing or misconfigured security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection).
* **HTTP — Improper Redirect**: identifying open redirect or incorrect redirect handling allowing forged flows.
* **HTTP — Verb Tampering**: testing for differences in handling between GET/POST/PUT/DELETE and abusing verb handling.

> Each of the above was confirmed via controlled testing, documented in engagement reports and, where appropriate, responsibly disclosed.

## 🔬 Typical Pentest Workflow

1. **Reconnaissance & Scanning** — DNS enumeration, port/service discovery, technology fingerprinting.
2. **Enumeration** — directory bruteforce, endpoint mapping, parameter discovery.
3. **Vulnerability Discovery** — automated scans + manual verification (Burp + custom scripts).
4. **Exploit & Proof-of-Concept** — carefully produce PoCs for confirmed issues (no destructive testing without permission).
5. **Reporting & Remediation Guidance** — clear findings, CVSS estimates, reproduction steps and remediation suggestions.

## 📁 Selected Projects / Demos

* **Internal Web App Audit (example)** — full web app assessment covering OWASP Top 10 issues, authenticated testing, and session management.
* **Network Segmentation Review** — scanned and validated segmentation controls, identified firewall misconfigurations.
* **CTF Write-ups** — several CTF challenges solved that demonstrate web and network exploitation skills(tryhackme , hack the box ).

> See the `projects/` folder for write-ups, PoCs and sanitized reports.

## ⚖️ Responsible Disclosure

I follow responsible disclosure policies: all real-world testing is performed with explicit authorization, and sensitive details/traces are kept out of public repositories unless sanitized or permissioned.
